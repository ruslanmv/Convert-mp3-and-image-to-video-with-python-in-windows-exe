# How to create exe application that convert mp3 to video by using python 

Hello everyone, today I will explain  you how to create an executable Windows application with python.

We are interested to create  program that convert a simple mp3 audio to mp3 static image, and create an executable .exe program.

We want to create an application with  GUI window that converts a .mp3 audio file and an image into a .mp4 video

### Step 1 Installation of Conda

First you need to install anaconda at this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

![img](assets/images/posts/README/1.jpg)

in this location **C:\Anaconda3** , then you, check that your terminal , recognize **conda**

```
C:\conda --version
conda 4.12.0
```

## Step 2 Environment creation

The environments supported that I will consider is Python 3.10.5,

I will create an environment called **mp3-to-video **, but you can put the name that you like.

```
conda create  -y -n mp3-to-video python==3.10.5
```

and then type

```
conda activate mp3-to-video
```

You will have something like this:

```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19044.1706]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
C:\Users\ruslanmv>conda activate keras
(mp3-to-video) C:\Users\ruslanmv>
```

then in your terminal type the following commands:

```
conda install -y -c conda-forge ffmpeg gooey
```

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Step 3  Creation of the code.

FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. At its core is the command-line ffmpeg tool itself, designed for processing of video and audio files

We are going to use ffmpeg application con to convert an mp3 into a mp4 with a simple image.jpg

If we want to convert a single image.jpg with an audio.mp3 into a output.mp4 we can use the following command

```
ffmpeg -i image.jpg -i audio.mp3 output.mp4
```

However for this project we want to customize a little the parameters

```
ffmpeg -loop 1 -framerate 1 -i image.jpg -i audio.mp3 -map 0:v -map 1:a -r 10 -vf "scale='iw-mod(iw,2)':'ih-mod(ih,2)',format=yuv420p" -movflags +faststart -shortest -fflags +shortest -max_interleave_delta 100M output.mp4
```

Where

- `-loop 1` makes `input.png` loop indefinitely.

- `-framerate 1` sets `input.png` input frame rate to 1 fps.

- `-map 0 -map 1:a` chooses the video from `image.png` and only the audio from `audio.mp3`. 

  This is needed in case `image.png` is smaller than any album/cover art attached to the MP3. 

- `-r 10` sets output frame rate to 10 fps. Setting input to 1 fps and output to 10 fps is for two reasons:

  - It is faster to input as 1 fps and duplicate frames to 10 fps compared to initially setting the input as 10 fps. It makes encoding faster.
  - Most players can't play anything under ~6 fps or so. 10 is a safe value.

- `scale='iw-mod(iw,2)':'ih-mod(ih,2)'` uses [scale filter](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#scale) to make sure the output width and height are both divisible by 2 which is a requirement for some encoders. This allows you to use any arbitrarily sized image as an input. Otherwise you can get error: `width not divisible by 2`.

- `format=yuv420p` [format filter](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#format) makes output use YUV 4:2:0 chroma subsampling for playback compatibility.

- `-movflags +faststart` makes the video start playing faster.

- `-shortest` makes the output as long as `audio.mp3`. This is needed because `-loop 1` was used.

- `-fflags +shortest -max_interleave_delta 100M` related to `-shortest` and needed in some cases due to weird behavior by ffmpeg.

So in ordering to create this program we go to our terminal and we create a a folder

```
cd \
mkdir app
cd app
mkdir src
cd src
```

we are in the src folder, there we create the following **main.py**

```python
from pathlib import Path
import subprocess
import platform

from gooey import Gooey, GooeyParser


@Gooey(dump_build_config=False, program_name="Audio to Video Conversion Tool")
def main():
    desc = "A Python GUI App to convert a .mp3 and an image into a .mp4"
    mp3_select_help_msg = "Select a .mp3 audio file to process"
    image_select_help_msg = "Select an image file (.png or .jpg) to use in the video"

    my_parser = GooeyParser(description=desc)
    my_parser.add_argument(
        "mp3_to_convert", help=mp3_select_help_msg, widget="FileChooser"
    )
    my_parser.add_argument(
        "image_to_convert", help=image_select_help_msg, widget="FileChooser"
    )
    my_parser.add_argument(
        "output_dir", help="Directory to save output", widget="DirChooser"
    )

    args = my_parser.parse_args()

    # construct the .mp3 input audio file path
    mp3_to_convert_Path = Path(args.mp3_to_convert)

    # construct image file path
    image_to_convert_Path = Path(args.image_to_convert)

    mp4_outfile_name = str(mp3_to_convert_Path.stem) + "_video.mp4"
    mp4_outfile_Path = Path(args.output_dir, mp4_outfile_name)
    mp4_outfile_Path.unlink(missing_ok=True) # delete the .mp4 file if it's there

    # Determine ffmpeg executable file path
    """
    where ffmpeg
    """
    if platform.system() == 'Windows':

        ffmpeg_path_bytes = subprocess.check_output("where ffmpeg", shell=True) 
        
    elif platform.system() == 'Linux':
        ffmpeg_path_bytes = subprocess.check_output("which ffmpeg", shell=True) 

    ffmpeg_executable_path = ffmpeg_path_bytes.decode().strip()
    print("ffmpeg_executable_path: ", ffmpeg_executable_path)

    # create the ffmpeg command
    """
    ffmpeg -i image.jpg -i audio.mp3 out.mp3 (basic)
    """
    aux = '''-map 0:v -map 1:a -r 10 -vf "scale='iw-mod(iw,2)':'ih-mod(ih,2)',format=yuv420p" -movflags +faststart -shortest -fflags +shortest -max_interleave_delta 100M '''
    ffmpeg_command = f"-loop 1 -framerate 1 -i {image_to_convert_Path} -i {mp3_to_convert_Path}  {aux}  {mp4_outfile_Path}"
    cmd_command = f"{ffmpeg_executable_path} {ffmpeg_command}"


    print(f"input .mp3 file \n {mp3_to_convert_Path}")
    print()
    print(f"input image file \n {image_to_convert_Path}")
    print()
    print(f"output .mp4 file \n {mp4_outfile_Path}")
    print()
    print("cmd prompt command: ")
    print()
  

    # call ffmpeg
    returned_value = subprocess.call(cmd_command, shell=True)# returns the exit code in unix
    
    print("returned value:", returned_value)

if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()

```

you will have something like 

![image-20220729212707552](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220729212707552.png)

## Step 4  Creation of the executable program

Here we go to our terminal

```
conda activate mp3-to-video
cd  c:\app\src
```

you will have something like

```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19044.1826]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\ruslanmv>conda activate mp3-to-video

(mp3-to-video) C:\Users\ruslanmv>cd c:\app\src

(mp3-to-video) c:\app\src>
```

then you  type the "magic "command 

```
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
```

and you wait like 2 minutes and you got the following output

```
(mp3-to-video) c:\app\src>pyinstaller --onefile main.py

```

then inside of the folder dist

![image-20220729213622086](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220729213622086.png)

you have created you .exe file

![image-20220729213708852](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220729213708852.png)

you click twice to  main.exe

![image-20220729213803392](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220729213803392.png)

You can choose the mp3 file and the image to convert and also you choose the folder where you want that your video file will be created

and click start.

![image-20220729220608308](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220729220608308.png)

And wuala, you have created an Windows .exe application by using Python.

![image-20220729220636536](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220729220636536.png)



![image-20220729225804804](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220729225804804.png)

this is the result:

**Congratulations!** you have created an application that convert mp3 to mp4 with static image.
